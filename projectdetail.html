    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>When creating your own portfolio, you the creator have the ability to put out your best work. This would apply to applying for a business or organization during or after graduating school, or for your own business to share with furture clients.</p>
    <p>And as someone who have some experiences with creating portfolios and a website dedicated to my best work I have done over the years, I have the gist of knowing and understanding what work I need to include in my portfolio that aligns with the job position or just presenting my best works in general.</p> 
   <p>However, when it comes to creating a portfolio website that revolves around creating the wireframes, mockup and the actual website through coding, it still continues to be a learning experience for me.</p>
